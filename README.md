**Project Goals**

* Create a functioning app by following the spec below
* Use create-react app to create a functional single-page application
* Use react-testing-library and jest to unit and integration test
* Use functional and class based components where they are required
* Write clean code that follows the Single Responsibility Principle
* Build a strong testing suite using TDD
* Utilize a pre-built API and build a new API to satisfy spec functionality 

**Wins**

* Getting react-router to mimic a multi-page application 
* Getting a strong understanding of how to correctly interact with state 
* Getting a strong understanding of the pros/cons of async/await 
* Getting our first jest / react-testing library suites working (including api mocking)
* Deploying an API to herokuapp 

**Challenges**

* Tackling a bug of wrapping our application in router twice (broke most testing) 
* Figuring out how to update child components through parent state updates
